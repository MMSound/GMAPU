# GMAPU
GameMaker Audio Processing Unit - sample-based audio playback in GameMaker

GMAPU is a 100% pure GML system for playing back sample-based music in GameMaker. This is perhaps one of the most unnecessary libraries ever, and poses no benefits over traditional audio playback, except for perhaps being a little more fun.

FEATURES:
- Mid-song volume and tempo changes
- Volume fading and pitch control
- Looping
- Simple music format in the style of trackers
- Up to as many sound channels as GameMaker can handle
- Relatively performant (I think)
- Playing, pausing, resuming, and stopping playback of music

This library is 100% free for all personal and commercial purposes, with credit given to MiniMacro Sound.
